    review: "5 stars! I had a wonderful experience. Rita was kind, and treated me to a relaxing deep tissue massage. I scheduled for 1hr and asked for more time, and she added an extra 10min! I was in a lot of pain, and she melted it away by walking on my back!! Highly recommended and I will return and ask for Rita! Thanks so much!",

    review: "I have been here three times and I will continue to come every two weeks! The massage is amazing and a knock out price for 60 minutes. They always schedule me in when I need same day massage and have been professional every time. They are so close to my house at 51st ave and Olive and I suggest everyone go and enjoy the foot detox/ full body massage!",
